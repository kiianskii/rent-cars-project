Car Rental Service
Welcome to Car Rental Service! Our app is your gateway to unlocking the road to adventure with hassle-free car rentals. Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or a long road trip, we've got you covered. Here's a breakdown of the key features and functionalities of our app:

Navigation: Our app offers seamless navigation with three main pages - Home, Catalogue, and Favorites, all implemented using routing.

Home Page: On the Home page we simply described main function of our service.

Catalogue Page: The Catalogue page showcases an array of available vehicles. You can scroll through the catalog and load more car cards using the "Load More" button. When you reach the end of the catalog, the button disappears, indicating that you've seen all the available options.

Favorite Cars: Each car card on the Catalogue page has a heart-shaped button that allows you to add the car to your Favorites. This feature helps you keep track of the vehicles you're interested in. The Favorites page stores all the car cards you've added to your Favorites. This helps you quickly access and compare your preferred vehicles.

Filtering: You can filter cars by Car Brand, Price per Hour, and Car Mileage in kilometers.

No Cars Available: On the Favorites page, if you haven't added any cars to your favorites, you'll see a message indicating "No favorite cars yet. Choose car you want." This message lets you know that you haven't saved any cars yet.
